This software is a result of a research project that aims to detect emotions of crowds at a speech by detecting as many person’s emotions using visual and auditory information as possible, then averaging these emotions to arrive at the crowd’s emotional state. 
<br />
To test the software, clone the repository, make sure you have python 3 installed on your local machine and run the main.py file. This will display and analyze a default video from the test data. 
<br />
To change the video that is being analyzed, add the desired file to the "test_data" folder, then change the 76th line in the main.py file from `Main('test_data/bosnia_trimmed.mp4')` to `Main('test_data/your_file_name.mp4')`. Running main.py will analyze your video now.
